This Repo Contains The task for my internship in Sparks Foundation 

Task 1:- 
Prediction Using Supervised ML
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

Task 2:-
Prediction Using Unsupervised ML
In this task,we will use the iris dataset,to predict the optimum number of cluster.

Task 3:-
Exploratory Data Analysis 
● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

Task 4:-
Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism 
● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’
● As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.
● What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?

Task 5:-
Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports
● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’
● As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team.
● Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products.

Task 6 :- 
Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
